# vite-plugin-compile-time

[![npm version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/vite-plugin-compile-time?v=2)](https://npm.im/vite-plugin-compile-time) [![npm downloads](https://badgen.net/npm/dm/vite-plugin-compile-time?v=2)](https://npm.im/vite-plugin-compile-time)

Use this plugin to get data at compile time in your Vite projects.

## Install

```bash
npm i vite-plugin-compile-time -D
```

In **vite.config.ts**:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite"
import compileTime from "vite-plugin-compile-time"

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [compileTime()],
})
```

In **tsconfig.json**:

```jsonc
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "types": [
      // ...,
      "vite-plugin-compile-time/client"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Usage

Compile-time data:

```ts
import fs from "fs"

const post = compileTime(async () => {
  const post = await fs.promises.readFile("./post.md", "utf8")
  return {
    data: { post },
  }
})

assert.equal(post, "...the content of the post...")
```

## Caveats

The files where you call `compileTime` will be evaluated at build time in Node.js environment, which means you should avoid calling browser APIs on the top level. It's recommended to use `compileTime` in a separate file and import it in your app.
